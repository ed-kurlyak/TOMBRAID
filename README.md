# TOMBRAID

Tomb Radier 1 reverse engineering test version, no DirectX/OpenGL, software rendering project.

Thank you very much to LostArtefacts & Marcin Kurczewski for previous job, this reverse engineering was done partially and source code is maximum close to original Core Design EXE code.

Tested under Win 10. Compiled on Visual Studio 2019.

Code is in an unfinished state, but playing is possible. Put levels files to DATA directory. See winmain.cpp for config.

Features:

1) for rendering triangles used original Core Desing functions
2) used 8- bit backbuffer SCITECH Mega Graph Library from Quake 1
3) for sound used Direct Sound 8
